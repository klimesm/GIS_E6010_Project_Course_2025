Email to Jussi that we are the group doing this project and asking about the dataset that needs to be purchased on behalf of Aalto. Is there something else we should be aware of before contacting the client?

Questions:
- If we need to do computationally heavy things (e.g. train a neural network), where do we get the necessary computing power?
- From where do we get the data from the Hytky project (2023)? 

â†’ Contacting the client, asking for an (online?) meeting in order to discuss the project and get answers to the questions (listed in the email)

Questions:
- From how large an area are pilot results expected? 
- Is the primary goal ditch detection or classification such as age condition or intended use?

Questions:
- How accurate do the ditch detection and classification results need to be?
